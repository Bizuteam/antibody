# antibody
fake first year project

## Ideas

* Use Zelkow in order to generate monsters' pesudonyms ? (have a db from some random game ?)
* Implement one important algorithm (viterbi, for example ?)
* Use a client-server architecture : The state of the game is in the server, and the client simply renders the data sent by the server.

## Requirements

It appears that the project has to be done in C lang. 
Some FFI ? :D
